#VHDL FPGA BOARD VENDING MACHINE 
# VHDL FPGA Board Vending Machine

Welcome to the VHDL FPGA Board Vending Machine project repository! This project aims to implement a vending machine using VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) targeted for FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) development boards. The vending machine simulates the functionality of a real-world vending machine, enabling users to select items, make payments, and receive their chosen items. Below, you'll find an overview of the project, its features, and instructions for running and testing the code on an FPGA development board.

## Features

- **Item Selection**: Users can navigate through a menu displayed on an optional LCD or LED display to select items they wish to purchase.
- **Payment Processing**: Various payment methods, including coins, bills, or electronic payments, are supported. The vending machine verifies and processes payments securely.
- **Item Dispensing**: Once the payment is successfully processed, the vending machine dispenses the selected item to the user.
- **User Interface**: The vending machine boasts an intuitive user interface, ensuring easy interaction for users of all levels.

## Requirements

To get started with this project, you'll need the following:

- FPGA Development Board (e.g., Xilinx, Altera)
- VHDL Synthesis Tool (e.g., Xilinx Vivado, Altera Quartus)
- Optional: LCD or LED Display for user interface

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the VHDL FPGA Board Vending Machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vhdl-fpga-vending-machine.git
   ```

2. **Open in Synthesis Tool**: Open the project in your preferred VHDL synthesis tool (e.g., Xilinx Vivado, Altera Quartus).

3. **Synthesize Code**: Synthesize the VHDL code and generate the bitstream for your FPGA development board.

4. **Program the FPGA**: Program the FPGA with the generated bitstream.

5. **Connect Peripherals**: Connect the necessary peripherals, such as the LCD or LED display, to the FPGA development board.

6. **Power On and Interact**: Power on the FPGA board and start interacting with the vending machine using the user interface.

## Testing

Ensure the functionality of the vending machine by thoroughly testing its features. Test item selection, payment processing, and item dispensing to verify that everything works as expected.
